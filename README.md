# Alfred's workflow to translate text on the fly

TL;DR:

![tl;dr](tldr.gif)

## Philosophy

I bet you know that feeling when you need to translate a word (or a phrase) and have to switch to a browser, copy a translation, and return back. Tedious, isn't it?  
Here's where [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) comes in. I love this tool and use it a thousand times a day. Unfortunately, I haven't found any translation-workflow that suits me&#42; so I wrote my own ãƒ„

&#42; I didn't like [the most popular solution](https://github.com/thomashempel/AlfredGoogleTranslateWorkflow) because of its verbosity (driven by a flexibility). Though it's may be what you're looking for.
